I got some good news fellas. I have been doing MOOCs for about 30 days now. And now the big question is - how has my life changed to the better or worse?

Well, it's definitely gotten a bit better, as I feel I have more agenda to my life as I have felt before,
and I have started to take things more by steps rather than 'Oh shit I want this SO BAD I will just ruminate over it and then give up'.

I have found that since I am so bad at my day work, the banquet service, that it's literally creeping into everything in my essence. So I decided that rather being a bitch about it, I will get better.

That's not saying that I will start enjoying the work though, as I would rather be doing X Y Z, but I will treat is as a true professional - without any emotions, get the yen and divorce my self from it the minute I am outside of work. No laying down to die sessions, the moment I come back home I will be all smiles and good times.

I won't say that I will do this 100% of the time always, but I will have enough 意識 to do so.

MOOCS - are they worth it? For the university experience - going to these "lectures" and learning and taking notes - GREAT STUFF. You got dry, academic knowledge, you get only the best of the best from the lectures (AHEM NO POWERPOINT LECTURES!), professional editing... Like, for long-distance learning, this is as good as it can get outside the traditional academia.

But the main problem of MOOCs is that even though it's giving students lectures and homework and projects, it's still very traditional pedagogy. I used to work in a science museum and one of the problems I had to tackle was how do we make science accessible to kids. How can we make learning fun?

It's like, there's only so much we can do... Kids learn one thing, they do another, to turn knowledge into action, it's so much and we got to be real too, there's no replacement to personalized teaching. Everybody thinks their own way, because they come from different backgrounds. A farm boy can understand grains and crop rotation better than a rich city girl, but a city girl may have read physics books and knows that white light has a wide spectrum of light... 

Both of this knowledge is needed to be an efficient farmer, but since they are on different starting points, they see things in a different point of view and they make different connections. MOOCs got the advantage of being massively accessible - anytime, anywhere - but not personal, and that's where the main shortcoming is. If you got a question, you ask your peers on the net in the discussion forums, but who are these people?
They post one thing too, and will it solve the problem for you or will it give you understanding behind the main concept?

So that's what I think. As social animals we need more direct guidance from our teachers. But still, I will pass. I don't want to go full normie and say "Oh man, I started and I got bored and quit"! Nah, that ain't me. Gonna PASS, yo!
