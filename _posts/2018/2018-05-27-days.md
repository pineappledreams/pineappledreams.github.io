I only wish I could say that I use my time with 100% effectiveness, but alas, sometimes you just have to enjoy the days with your loved ones as well.
Plus people think that doing a commit on github even though it's not code related is a sin, but au contraire, my friends.
I believe everything can be codified, and actions are just biological commands we do upon the world around us.

Which makes a real good question - would the Big Bang be like start of a program, and we are little transistors still doing it's little computation?

Ah, for today I did some a couple of exercises, tomorrow I'm gonna crunch on those kanjis. It's a grind, all right, but a damn good one.
