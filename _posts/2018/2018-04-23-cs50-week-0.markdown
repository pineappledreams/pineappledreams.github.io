Problem set 0 is about
1. Making a video to say hi (Optional)
2. Use scratch to program a little thing that uses 3 scripts and 2 items,
3. Upload the said file to github (really important!)
4. Fill out a form. End of Week 0!

I think I can definitely do Scratch tomorrow. It uses flash, but I gotta do it.
