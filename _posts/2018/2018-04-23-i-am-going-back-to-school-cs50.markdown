I have decided to join the MOOC meme and augment my education with these
free education things.

Back in university I just remember being mostly depressed and
really tired all the freaking time, since I wasn't anymore the bright
and talented kid I thought I was. Just being in class wasn't enough anymore.
Not to mention - the classes I had in university were absolutely abysmal.
Powerpoint slideshows and reading straight off the powerpoints was the name
of the game. Some "fun" classes as well with overbearing professionals,
but man, I wasn't a good student in university.
I did barely scratch by and graduate, but man, was I relieved that it was over.

I did try to go into master's studies as well after my military service
(it's compulsory for Estonians), but I had forgotten everything I had learned,
so I quickly dropped out and decided to start writing as a professional novelist.
I still write from time to time, but it didn't bring in the cash I wanted,
and let's be honest, ars gratia artis, right?

I got married and moved to Japan instead, and man, it's huge over here.
People come in, come out, movement is fast, it's katsuyaku as hell.
What's more important - people don't care about what I learned back then,
it's all about what I know right now. Man, that's just a breath of fresh air!

Now I had to face the problem - I want to study more, but I have my day-job,
I have a wife to take care of, I want to be a better myself but I might not
have the same care-free and ample time I had when I was 20. Enter the MOOC -
Massive Open Online Course.

I decided to start doing the MIT and CS50 introduction to CS on edX. It's free,
it's on your own pace and it's made to be really easily followable. Unlike
the Moodle and SAIS and Ã•IS and lecturer's personal sites with gargantuan passwords
(OC DONUT STEAL!), everything you would need to know is right up there on the MOOC site.
The best thing is that MOOCs is that it doesn't matter where I am physically.
The lecturer won't write down my name on the paper before class, it's me who is  
writing my own name whereever I might be. Ars gratia discipulo, I guess.
What else is that since MOOCs are competing with the infinitely more compelling
instant entertainment, then it's made in a way it's more engaging.

It's the future of education right here. Sure, there are going to be the problem
of certification, but in case of giving people the ability to keep on learning
outside the school halls, then it's just perfect.

As I am plowing through my studies, I will try to keep the notes up on Github
so can study with me and see if this MOOC thing is really for you or not.
Hell, I don't even know if it's for me either, but let's just go ahead and do it.
