Yo! 

It's quite scary sometimes out in the world, but the one thing I have done to is going to these technical meetups to ...
Well, meet new people and see what the hell people are doing.

The number ONE thing is that in these meet-ups I meet all these wonderful people, so I should be a good boy and actually remember the names and faces of the people I meet, because I totally fucked up and forgot one dude's face. The hurt on his face, man... God!!
It's like that book, How to Win Friends and Influence People - that story about Honest Abe and keeping tabs on his little notebook. Saying their names, writing it all down... Maybe I should start doing that too.

Well, my memory IS getting better though now that I started being more mindful and focusing in the moment.

There's a lot of things that could go better, but I think one thing would be reading up in the latest trends as there's loads of things to know about in the IT and start-up community.

Also I wrote my CV all over, this time it doesn't look like I'm trying too hard. It looks like a still lake now, without any pain and suffering. Maybe that's why things are going better these days? More tranquil mind, more focus... It's one of those good weeks of my life then!

EDIT 05/25

And like always, I count my chicken before they hatch. But if you look the big picture, I:m doing all right!
