Setting-up a public face using CSS, HTML, Javascript (wow!)
//

Just like many things in this world, you need to set up a public face for all to see. 
This is going to be the one glance, analyze, they pigeonhole that analyzed info
into a box and whether it will be true or not only be known whether it comes to
bite them in the ass or not. 

The boxes this page will be pigeonholed will be "agile", "dry" and "gold".

Here's the colorscheme:
Sand yellow rgb(251, 245, 234),
Desert sun rgb(255, 212, 128),
Ripe pineapple rgb(126, 100, 0),
Dust green rgb(75, 246, 196),
Oasis Green rgb(126, 159, 0)
White, black, etc. 

The concept is going to go for a nice crisp look, it should load and work fast, be responsive and alive to the user.
It's going to be refreshing like the smell of hay on a dry summer day.

Main page will be a little devlog,
read more will lead to blog,
and finally the about page to tell all about me.
