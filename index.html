Dear world, this is the new thing that I made.
You can see all the crap right here and it*ll be done when its done.

<br>Anyway, I just wanted to chip into the whole "TAB vs SPACE" debate
<br>The conclusion is "shut the heck up".

Anyway what I really want to do is like none of this Jekyll bullshit, but
just make a thing that would take X Y Z TXT files and fucking make it into
a standardized web page thingaling. Shouldnt be too hard huh?!
